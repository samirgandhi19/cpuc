this repo is for a poc,
and includes Oracle pk generation study

Looks like we need a doc section on Oracle Keys
	- we expect sequences, as explained here:
		https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-define-an-auto-increment-primary-key-in-oracle/
	- we also support generated by default?  (Oracle 12c or higher only)
		CREATE TABLE books (
			  id      NUMBER        GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
			  title   VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL
		);
		CREATE TABLE tsqx2.books (
		   id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
		   description VARCHAR2(30)
		);
	- you are always free to use early events with functions / procedures
